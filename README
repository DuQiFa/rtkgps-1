				RtkGPS

RtkGPS allows device configuration, status reporting, and log
downloading for some models (RBT-2300 and RGM-3800) of Royaltek GPS
loggers. RtkGPS provides a command line interface (unlike some of the
other software for this device, which is GUI based), but should work
on any Linux platform, including portable devices such as the Nokia
770/800 series.

Unless disabled at compile time (see the INSTALL file), RtkGPS
corrects the altitude values read from the logger by estimating the
EGM96 geoid undulations with respect to the WGS-84 ellipsoid. If
building from source, this facility is not available when running the
executable from the source directory, since the required data file is
not accessible until installation by "make install".

Similar Software:

* Manufacturer supplied software from Royaltek, supporting Windows and
  Palm platforms.
* rgm3800-client (http://www.kbdbabel.org/rgm3800-client.c), by
  Alexander Kurz, is designed for the RGM-3800 logger, with a USB
  connection, and works under Linux.
* rgm3800.py (http://www.kapet.de/rgm3800/), by Karsten Petersen,
  is written in Python, and is designed for the RGM-3800 logger.
* RBT_2300 (http://aeropic.free.fr/RBT_2300) by "Aeropic" is designed
  for the RBT-2300, and works on Microsoft platforms (including Pocket
  PC, not supported by the manufacturer software).
* Jdatalog
  (http://www.gpspassion.com/forumsen/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=106198) by
  "Denti13" is written in Java, and apparently works under Linux.

Acknowledgments:

* This software would not have been possible without the details of
  the communications protocol kindly provided by "Aeropic", author of
  the Pocket PC software RBT_2300.
* A few additional commands in the communications protocol were
  discovered in the rgm3800.py software by Karsten Petersen.
* Some useful implementation ideas were copied from the rgm3800-client
  software by Alexander Kurz.
* The serial port code was written using the "Serial Programming Guide
  for POSIX Operating Systems" guide by Michael R. Sweet.
* The bluetooth scanning and socket connection code is based on the
  example code by Albert Huang and Larry Rudolph (see
  http://www.btessentials.com/examples/examples.html).
* Thanks to Francois Deppierraz <francois at ctrlaltdel dot ch> for
  pointing out an error (and providing data to help correct it) in 
  the NMEA longitude output in version 0.02.
* Thanks to Martin Weber <martin dot weber at gmx dot info> for
  pointing out some bugs, and submitting numerous patches, including
  improvements in support for the RGM3800, and support for compiling
  under the Cygwin environment.
