	* Modified gpsfmt.c functions print_log_nmea and
	geoid_calc_correction to give more consistent floating points
	results across different platforms. In configure.ac, also added
	-ffloat-store to CFLAGS for the same purpose.
	* Changed behaviour of read command with -u flag so that an empty
	file is not skipped.
	* Improved error handling in file_read function in rtkgps.c to
	include deletion of the empty file into which the data was to be
	read.

	* Fixed memory used calculation (for status command) when logger
	in memory overwrite mode.
	* Changed standard output filename format so that filename
	preserved after logfile numbering shifts when logger in memory
	overwrite mode. Using the previous format, filenames were not
	preserved, leading to possible data loss when downloading using
	the -u flag.
	* Modified behaviour of -u flag so that the final (partial)
	logfile is still downloaded even when the -u flags is specified.
