                      Significant changes in RtkGPS
                      -----------------------------

Version 0.07 (2012-02-04)
-------------------------

  * Changed compiler flags and geoid correction code to reduce
    occurrences of small cross-platform differences in NMEA output.
  * Improved error handling for read command to include deletion of
    the empty file resulting from a failed read.
  * Changed behaviour of read command with -u flag so that an empty
    file is not skipped. 


Version 0.06 (2010-06-04)
-------------------------

  * Fixed status command memory used calculation in the case that
    memory has wrapped around in overwrite mode  
  * Changed standard output filename format to be the date and time of
    the first fix in the log file. This change was necessary since,
    using the previous format, filenames were not preserved on memory
    wrap around in overwrite mode, leading to possible data loss when
    downloading using the -u flag.
  * Modified behaviour of -u flag so that the final (partial)
    logfile is still downloaded even when the -u flags is specified.
  * Introduced rtknmea, a Python script for collating GPX files and
    converting them to GPX format.


Version 0.05 (2009-11-21)
-------------------------

  * Support for RGM-3800 device, contributed by Martin Weber.
  * Fixed slight deviation from correct NMEA format in output.
  * Source can be compiled under Cygwin environment.
  * Command line flag requesting download of new files only.
  * Device bluetooth address written in NMEA header, when available.


Version 0.04 (2009-01-31)
-------------------------

  * Updated log download communication protocol.
  * Modified data download command to backup existing files before
    overwriting them.
  * Made some code changes in an attempt to support changes reported
    in a recent RBT-2300 firmware version. These changes have not been
    verified to work, as a device with the new firmware is not
    available for testing.


Version 0.03 (2008-06-30)
-------------------------

  * Fixed error in selection of 'W' or 'E' flag in NMEA longitudes. 


Version 0.02 (2008-06-25)
-------------------------

 * Added calculation of geoid correction to altitude values in
   downloaded log data.
 * Added date command to display current UTC date/time.
 * Added -p option to read command to request display of a text
   progress indicator during data download.
 * Modified standard output filename to include "_part" for the last
   file in memory, to indicate that the file is not complete at the
   time of downloading.
 * Fixed error in format of GPRMC NMEA sentences constructed by read
   command.
 * Fixed error in NMEA sentence checksums constructed by read command.
 * Fixed memory allocation bug and error handling bug in
   implementation of erase command.


Version 0.01 (2008-05-10)
-------------------------

  * Initial release
